## Python
| Project Link  | Completion Date | Libraries  | Project Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 🚲 🔋 [Closest Distance](https://github.com/leticiatca/ClosestDistance)  | November 2023  | Pandas, Geopy, Math (Radians, Dist), SKlearn (DistanceMetric, Pairwise_distances)| (Data Pre-processing, Wrangling and Enrichment) This project contains two Jupyter notebooks with similar projects on two different scopes: Both look to estimate the closest distance between two points. In one of the files you can see a model that uses latitude and longitude to calculate the euclidean distance between house coordinates in Boston to the closest Blue Bike station. The second model uses a public dataset from the city of Boston to find the coordinates of houses and maps the closest electric vehicle charging station. |

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 🚲 [Blue Bikes](https://github.com/leticiatca/ChargingStationsDatabase)| December 2023  | Similar to 'Closest Distance' project done in Python but completed using SQL. This uses two separate datasets to create a database with homes in Boston and the respective closest Blue Bike Station to it. SQL code also includes use of conditional statments to find elements within the database.  |
