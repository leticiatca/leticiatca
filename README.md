| Project Link  | Completion Date | Libraries  | Project Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 🚲 🔋 [Closest Distance](https://github.com/leticiatca/ClosestDistance)  | November 2023  | Pandas, Geopy, Math (Radians, Dist), SKlearn (DistanceMetric, Pairwise_distances)| (Data Pre-processing, Wrangling and Enrichment) This project contains two Jupyter notebooks with similar projects on two different scopes: Both look to estimate the closest distance between two points. In one of the files you can see a model that uses latitude and longitude to calculate the euclidean distance between house coordinates in Boston to the closest Blue Bike station. The second model uses a public dataset from the city of Boston to find the coordinates of houses and maps the closest electric vehicle charging station. |
