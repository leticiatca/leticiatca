## Python
| Project Link  | Completion Date | Libraries  | Project Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 🚲 🔋 [Closest Distance](https://github.com/leticiatca/ClosestDistance)  | November 2023  | Pandas, Geopy, Math (Radians, Dist), SKlearn (DistanceMetric, Pairwise_distances)| This project contains two Jupyter notebooks with similar projects on two different scopes: Both look to estimate the closest distance between two points. In one of the files you can see a model that uses latitude and longitude to calculate the euclidean distance between house coordinates in Boston to the closest Blue Bike station. The second model uses a public dataset from the city of Boston to find the coordinates of houses and maps the closest electric vehicle charging station. |

## R
| Project Link  | Completion Date | Libraries  | Project Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 🏕️ [Outdoor Retailer Analysis](https://github.com/leticiatca/RetailerAnalysis) | November 2023 | dplyr, tidyverse, stringr, moments, ggplot | Analysis of how to improve profitability and customer satisfaction in an outdoor gear company looking at consumer and transaction data.  |

| 🚀 [NASA Visualizations](https://github.com/leticiatca/NASAvisualizations/tree/main) | February 2024  | This case looks at data from the failed NASA challenger launch and aims to propose solutions on how the data could have been better presented to avoid a disaster.  | [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NASA_Dashboard_17119304651920/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
| 🛋️ [Superstore Dataset](https://github.com/leticiatca/RetailerVisualizations) | January 2024  | Used a dataset containing sales data of a superstore from 2020-2023 to analyze profits comparing performance across regions within the US, across categories and sub-categories of products and idenitfying areas of improvement.| [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperstoreDatasetA2-LeticiaTeixeira/StorySouth?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  |

## SQL

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 🚲 [Blue Bikes](https://github.com/leticiatca/ChargingStationsDatabase)| December 2023  | Similar to 'Closest Distance' project done in Python but completed using SQL. This uses two separate datasets to create a database with homes in Boston and the respective closest Blue Bike Station to it. SQL code also includes use of conditional statments to find elements within the database.  |
